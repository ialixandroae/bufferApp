This aplication shows the capability of including action buttons into popup windows and create different functionalities.
The action button inserted into the popup windows will create a buffer and the radius of the buffer will be the value inserted into the input box on the left side of the frame. The value can by modified from 0 to 15 and the buffer radius will respect it.

Also, a total number of features located inside the buffer will be displayed.
